-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The *most* sophisticated background **location-tracking & geofencing** module with battery-conscious motion-detection intelligence for **iOS** and **Android**.

The plugin's [Philosophy of Operation](../../wiki/Philosophy-of-Operation) is to use **motion-detection** APIs (using accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer) to detect when the device is *moving* and *stationary*.  

- When the device is detected to be **moving**, the plugin will *automatically* start recording a location according to the configured `distanceFilter` (meters).  

- When the device is detected be **stationary**, the plugin will automatically turn off location-services to conserve energy.

Also available for [React Native](https://github.com/transistorsoft/react-native-background-geolocation), [NativeScript](https://github.com/transistorsoft/nativescript-background-geolocation-lt) and pure native apps.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **[Android plugin](http://www.transistorsoft.com/shop/products/cordova-background-geolocation)** requires [purchasing a license](http://www.transistorsoft.com/shop/products/cordova-background-geolocation).  However, it *will* work for **DEBUG** builds.  It will **not** work with **RELEASE** builds [without purchasing a license](http://www.transistorsoft.com/shop/products/cordova-background-geolocation).

(2018) This plugin is supported **full-time** and field-tested **daily** since 2013.

## :large_blue_diamond: Installing the plugin ##

#### From npm 

```bash
$ cordova plugin add cordova-background-geolocation-lt
```

#### Phonegap Build

```xml
  <plugin name="cordova-background-geolocation-lt" source="npm">

  </plugin>
```

#### From master (latest, greatest.)

```
$ cordova plugin add https://github.com/transistorsoft/cordova-background-geolocation-lt.git
```

## :large_blue_diamond: Android SDK

If building from your local machine (as you should be), ensure you have the following items installed or updated in Android SDK Manager
#### SDK Tools
![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/qdscbas4krc27c4/android-sdk-tools.png?dl=1)
#### SDK Platforms
![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/qetghugog00puz2/android-sdk-platforms.png?dl=1)


## :large_blue_diamond: Configuring the plugin

After adding the plugin, your `config.xml` will contain the following block, containing a number of `<variable />` for you to configure (eg: `LICENSE`):

```xml
<widget id="com.your.company.app.id">
  <plugin name="cordova-background-geolocation-lt">
    <variable name="LICENSE" value="YOUR_LICENSE_KEY" />
    <variable name="GOOGLE_API_VERSION" value="11.6.0" />
    <variable name="APPCOMPAT_VERSION" value="26.1.0" />
    <variable name="LOCATION_ALWAYS_AND_WHEN_IN_USE_USAGE_DESCRIPTION" value="Always use is required for background location tracking" />
    <variable name="LOCATION_ALWAYS_USAGE_DESCRIPTION" value="Background location-tracking is required" />
    <variable name="LOCATION_WHEN_IN_USE_USAGE_DESCRIPTION" value="Background location-tracking is required" />
    <variable name="MOTION_USAGE_DESCRIPTION" value="Using the accelerometer increases battery-efficiency by intelligently toggling location-tracking only when the device is detected to be moving" />
  </plugin>
  .
  .
  .
</widget>
```

To configure these `<variable />`, you simply re-add the plugin, providing desired `--variable` to the `cordova plugin add` command.  You can combine multiple `--variable` together in *one* command or execute `cordova plugin add` *successivly*.

```
$ cordova plugin add cordova-background-geolocation-lt --variable VARIABLE_NAME=value

$ cordova platform remove android
$ cordova platform add android
```

:exclamation: To apply changes to these `<variable />`, you **must** remove/re-add the cordova platform(s)

#### Configuring Multiple Variables at Once

Use the `\` character followed by [`ENTER`] in console to configure multiple variables with one command:

```bash
$ cordova plugin add cordova-background-geolocation-lt \
  --variable LICENSE=your_key_here \
  --variable GOOGLE_API_VERSION=11.6.0 \
  --variable APPCOMPAT_VERSION=27.0.0 \
  --variable MOTION_USAGE_DESCRIPTION="My motion usage description"

$ cordova platform remove android
$ cordova platform add android

$ cordova platform remove ios
$ cordova platform add ios
```

#### Or each variable separately

```bash
$ cordova plugin add cordova-background-geolocation-lt --variable MOTION_USAGE_DESCRIPTION="My Motion Usage Description"

$ cordova plugin add cordova-background-geolocation-lt --variable LOCATION_ALWAYS_AND_WHEN_IN_USE_USAGE_DESCRIPTION="My Usage Description"

$ cordova platform remove ios
$ cordova platform add ios
```

#### After editing variables, ALWAYS REMOVE / RE-ADD PLATFORM

```bash
$ cordova platform remove android
$ cordova platform add android

$ cordova platform remove ios
$ cordova platform add ios

```

#### Configuring your LICENSE key

After generating your Android license-key in the [Product Dashboard](http://www.transistorsoft.com/shop/customers), Configure the `LICENSE` variable:

```bash
$ cordova plugin add cordova-background-geolocation-lt --variable LICENSE=your_key_here

// Remove / re-add the Android platform
$ cordova platform remove android
$ cordova platform add android
```

#### Configuring `play-services` Version

Many other plugins require Google Play Services and/or Firebase libraries.  This is a common source of Android build-failures, since the `play-services` library version must be aligned to the same version for **all** plugins.  For example, when one plugin imports version `11.0.1` and another one imports `11.2.0`, a gradle build failure will occur.  Use the `GOOGLE_API_VERSION` to align the required `play-services` version with other plugins.

:warning: The plugin requires a minimum version of **`11.2.0`**.

```bash
$ cordova plugin add cordova-background-geolocation-lt --variable GOOGLE_API_VERSION=11.2.0
$ cordova platform remove android
$ cordova platform add android
```

#### Configuring for `useSignificantChangesOnly`

For those using `useSignificantChangesOnly: true`, possibly because Apple *denied* your use of the background `location` capability, you can disable background `location` by providing the `BACKGROUND_MODE_LOCATION` `<variable />` with an empty-string:

```bash
$ cordova plugin add cordova-background-geolocation-lt --variable BACKGROUND_MODE_LOCATION=""

$ cordova platform remove ios
$ cordova platform add ios
```


## Configuration Variables

### Android

##### `@variable LICENSE [""]`
Your Android license key generated from [Product Dashboard](http://www.transistorsoft.com/shop/customers)

##### `@variable GOOGLE_API_VERSION ["11.6.0"]`
Sets the desired version of `play-services-location` dependency.  Many other plugins require `play-services` dependencies, (eg: `cordova-plugin-googlemaps`, `phonegap-plugin-push`):  If the version of `play-services` and/or `firebase` is not aligned to the **same** version for **ALL** plugins, your build **will fail**.

##### `@variable APPCOMPAT_VERSION ["27.0.0"]`
Sets the desired version of `com.google.android.appcompat-v7` dependency.  Many other plugins can require a different version of `appcompat-v7` dependeny:  If the version of `appcompat-v7` is not aligned to the **same** version for **ALL** plugins, your build **will fail**.  `BackgroundGeolocation` requires a minimum version of `26.1.0` due to its support for Android 8.

### iOS

##### `@variable LOCATION_ALWAYS_AND_WHEN_IN_USE_USAGE_DESCRIPTION ["Background location-tracking is required"]`

Customize the message displayed to the user when `AlwaysAndWhenInUse` location authorization is requested.  This variable is added to your iOS `.plist` in the `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` key.

##### `@variable LOCATION_ALWAYS_USAGE_DESCRIPTION ["Background location-tracking is required"]`

**(deprecated in iOS 11.0)** Customize the message displayed to the user when `Always` location authorization is requested.  This variable is added to your iOS `.plist` in the `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` key.

##### `@variable LOCATION_WHEN_IN_USE_USAGE_DESCRIPTION ["Background location-tracking is required"`

Customize the message displayed to the user when `WhenInUse` location authorization is requested.  This variable is added to your iOS `.plist` in the `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` key.

##### `@variable MOTION_USAGE_DESCRIPTION ["Using the accelerometer increases battery-efficiency by..."`

Customize the message displayed to the user when "Motion & Fitness" permission is requested.  The plugin is **highly** optimized to use iOS `CMMotionActivityManager` API for intelligently toggling location-services only when the plugin is detected to be moving.

##### `@variable BACKGROUND_MODE_LOCATION ["&lt;string&gt;location&lt;/string&gt;"]`
Adds the iOS background-mode `location` to your iOS `.plist` file.  This is the default behaviour.  To disable this, (ie: for those using `useSignificantChangesOnly`), provide an empty-string:

```xml
  <variable name="BACKGROUND_MODE_LOCATION" value="" />
```

:warning: If you *do* want the default behaviour of background-location updates, simply **IGNORE** this variable -- Do **NOT** even provide it.  If you *do* provide it, you must provide the full escaped XML value of `&lt;string&gt;location&lt;/string&gt;` (the default value when not provided), not just `location`.


## :large_blue_diamond: Using the Plugin

The plugin creates the object **`window.BackgroundGeolocation`**.  See [API Documentation](docs) for details

### Ionic 2+ and Typescript

[Sample Implementation](https://gist.github.com/christocracy/2abf5587cc12b83e15aa12958de7a7d2)

```javascript
platform.ready().then(() => {
  let bgGeo = (<any>window).BackgroundGeolocation;
});

```

### Initialize the Plugin
There are **three** simple steps to using `BackgroundGeolocation`:

1. Listen to events
2. Execute [`#ready`](docs/README.md#readydefaultconfig-successfn-failurefn) 
3. `#start` the plugin

```javascript
// 1.  Listen to events
bgGeo.on('location', onLocation, onLocationFailure);
bgGeo.on('motionchange', onMotionChange);
bgGeo.on('providerchange', onProviderChange);

// 2. Execute #ready method:  
bgGeo.ready({  
  desiredAccuracy: 0,   // <-- Config params
  distanceFilter: 50
}, function(state) {    // <-- Current state provided to #configure callback
  // 3.  Start tracking
  console.log('BackgroundGeolocation is configured and ready to use');
  if (!state.enabled) {
    bgGeo.start(function() {
      console.log('- BackgroundGeolocation tracking started');
    });
  }
});
// NOTE:  Do NOT execute any API methods until the callback to #configure
// method above executes!
// For example, do not do this here:
// bgGeo.getCurrentPosition()   // <-- NO!
// bgGeo.start();               // <-- NO!
```

:information_source: **NOTE:** The configuration **`{}`** provided to the `#ready` method is applied **only** when your app is **first booted** &mdash; for every launch thereafter, the plugin will automatically load the last known configuration from persistant storage.  If you wish to **force** the `#ready` method to *always* apply the supplied config `{}`, you can specify **`reset: true`**

```javascript
bgGeo.ready({
  reset: true,  // <-- true to always apply the supplied config
  distanceFilter: 10
}, function(state) {
  console.log('- BackgroundGeolocation is ready: ', state);
});
```

:warning: Do not execute *any* API method which will require accessing location-services until the callback to **`#ready*` executes (eg: `#getCurrentPosition`, `#watchPosition`, `#start`).

### Promise API

The `BackgroundGeolocation` Javascript API supports [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) for *nearly* every method (the exceptions are **`#watchPosition`** and adding event-listeners via **`#on`** method.  For more information, see the [API Documentation](docs/README.md#large_blue_diamond-methods)

```javascript
// Traditional API still works:
bgGeo.ready({desiredAccuracy: 0, distanceFilter: 50}).then(state => {
  console.log('- BackgroundGeolocation is ready: ', state);
}).catch(error => {
  console.log('- BackgroundGeolocation error: ', error);
});
```

## :large_blue_diamond: Example

See [here](https://gist.github.com/christocracy/2abf5587cc12b83e15aa12958de7a7d2#file-backgroundgeolocation-ionic2-js) for an Ionic 3 example.

```javascript

////
// As with all Cordova plugins, you must configure within an #deviceready callback.
//
function onDeviceReady() {
    // Get a reference to the plugin.
    var bgGeo = window.BackgroundGeolocation;

    //This callback will be executed every time a geolocation is recorded in the background.
    var callbackFn = function(location) {
        var coords = location.coords;
        var lat    = coords.latitude;
        var lng    = coords.longitude;
        console.log('- Location: ', JSON.stringify(location));        
    };

    // This callback will be executed if a location-error occurs.  Eg: this will be called if user disables location-services.
    var failureFn = function(errorCode) {
        console.warn('- BackgroundGeoLocation error: ', errorCode);
    }

    // Listen to location events & errors.
    bgGeo.on('location', callbackFn, failureFn);
    // Fired whenever state changes from moving->stationary or vice-versa.
    bgGeo.on('motionchange', function(isMoving) {
      console.log('- onMotionChange: ', isMoving);
    });
    // Fired whenever a geofence transition occurs.
    bgGeo.on('geofence', function(geofence) {
      console.log('- onGeofence: ', geofence.identifier, geofence.location);
    });
    // Fired whenever an HTTP response is received from your server.
    bgGeo.on('http', function(response) {
      console.log('http success: ', response.responseText);
    }, function(response) {
      console.log('http failure: ', response.status);
    });

    // BackgroundGeoLocation is highly configurable.
    bgGeo.ready({
        // Geolocation config
        desiredAccuracy: 0,
        distanceFilter: 10,
        stationaryRadius: 25,
        // Activity Recognition config
        activityRecognitionInterval: 10000,
        stopTimeout: 5,
        // Application config
        debug: true,  // <-- Debug sounds & notifications.
        stopOnTerminate: false,
        startOnBoot: true,
        // HTTP / SQLite config
        url: "http://your.server.com/locations",
        method: "POST",
        autoSync: true,
        maxDaysToPersist: 3,
        headers: {  // <-- Optional HTTP headers
            "X-FOO": "bar"
        },
        params: {   // <-- Optional HTTP params
            "auth_token": "maybe_your_server_authenticates_via_token_YES?"
        }
    }, function(state) {
        // This callback is executed when the plugin is ready to use.
        console.log("BackgroundGeolocation ready: ", state);
        if (!state.enabled) {
            bgGeo.start();
        }
    });

    // The plugin is typically toggled with some button on your UI.
    function onToggleEnabled(value) {
        if (value) {
            bgGeo.start();
        } else {
            bgGeo.stop();
        }
    }
}

```
